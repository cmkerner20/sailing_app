Developing an Algorithm that classifies sections of sailing boat tracks. 

Things that need to be understood from sailing coach:
1. How will the results be used? Are false positives worse than false negatvies etc?

Technical Questions:
1. DataCleaning 
    1. Best way to standardize each file.
        * Standardize Longitude and Latitude (Unsure if subtract mean and standard deviation is the best way).
        * Sog - speed (unsure what the best way to standardize)
        * Cog any chance we can get angle from wind?
        * Other features should be removed.
